								<h2><b><u>Favorite Artists</u></b></h2>
								<h3><b>Jorja Smith</b></h3>
								<p>I fell in love with Jorja Smith's soothing voice and R&B music background after her album, <i>Lost & Found</i>. Personally, if you're a fan of bigger R&B artists like Drake, Kehlani, H.E.R, and Jhene Aiko, you would love Jorja Smith!</p>
								<p>My personal favorite song is her newest one which I know will be a part of her newest studio album  coming.</p>

								<h3><b>The Weeknd</b></h3>
								<p>The Weeknd is the biggest artist in the world right now. He performed at the Super Bowl a few months ago but most people have known him for his tremendous work for years. My favorite song by him changes everyday, but I managed to pick just one!!</p>

								<h3><b>Tame Impala</b></h3>
								<p>Tame Impala has been around for about a decade but I did not see him get the true recognition he deserves until the release of <i>The Slow Rush</i>. Don't get me wrong, his album <i>Currents</i> was a masterpiece, but I did not hear much from mainstream media about him. </p>
								<p>My favorite song by him is from <i>Currents</i>. This was one of the first songs I heard about him!!</P>

								<h2><b><u>Favorite TV Shows</u></b></h2>

								<h3><b>Criminal Minds</b></h3>
								<a href='https://postimages.org/' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/qM6GfWC3/Criminal-Minds-Key-Art-1920x1080-0.jpg' width= 500 height= 300 border='0' alt='Criminal Minds Cast'/></a>
								<p>Criminal Minds follows a group called the BAU, or Behavioral Analysis Unit in the FBI. Each episode follows the pursuit of criminals by making profiles of their behavior to catch them. The show also follows the personal relationships of the agents, and there are plenty of scary criminals that have I still think about today.</p>
								<p>I get scared easily, and I delayed my start to watch this show because I thought it would keep me up at night, but it's actually such an interesting show and I'd recommend to anyone that likes shows with tons of seasons! <i>(It has 15)</i>.</P>
								<h3><b>Grey's Anatomy</b></h3>
								<a href='https://postimg.cc/MnLYSk26' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/FKrC0mTL/greys-anatomy.jpg'width= 500 height= 300 border='0' alt='greys-anatomy'/></a>
								<p>Grey's Anatomy follows a group of surgical interns at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. When I first started this show I had no idea what I was getting myself into since there was so much drama, and real life instances that consumed these interns' lives. As fun as this show makes being a doctor seems, it is heavily fictional so I try not to keep my hopes up <i>lol</i>.</p>
								<h3><b>Money Heist</b></h3>
								<a href='https://postimages.org/' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/3rmjrVB5/AAAABTk-Zu-Z7z-x-Qq-Wl6-RTvg-XCRTSh-GOBS4-Dl14-Df-Glly3z-Xc8dw-Xz67-Qi-Dcassgy-OF5-B-QD3b-Xu-C9f0-GKFUS5w-p8-Vz-EYi-EKEqy.jpg' border='0' alt='Money Heist Cast'/></a><br /><a href='https://postimages.org/'></a><br />
								<p>This was literally one of the coolest shows I've ever watched. It's entirely in spanish but put on english subtitles and you'll be fine! One thing I learned is to not let shows that are in a different language deter you from watching them! </p>
<p>Money Heist is about a group led by the Professor and their ultimate task is to rob a bank, but obviously it's not easy and meticulous planning is involved. However, just by reading a description may not entice you, but <i>trust me</i> there were more twists than I've ever experienced on a show</p>
