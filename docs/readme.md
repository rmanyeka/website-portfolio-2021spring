Your final project files (html, css, images, etc) should go in here. **One of those files should be called index.html**: it will become your landing page. (Otherwise, your site will land on this readme.)

You can then publish this site to the open web: just go to your repository's Settings and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and change the source from "none" to "master branch /docs folder."
